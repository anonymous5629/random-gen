random-gen is a passion project made by me to start my programming journey. Its purpose is to make as many random generators for as many different things as possible. I am learning the basics of automation and other aspects of programming through this.
rng-v1.py is a random number generator that runs in the terminal. It can save items to files with names of your choosing and with as many digits as you want. You can also choose whether you want it to be negative or not or have the program randomly choose for you. If it is randomly chosen it will be randomly chosen for every number.
passwd-gen-v1.py is a secure password generator that can be customised with length and the amount of passwords it generates it uses all characters found on a keyboard and can also print passwords to a file though if you are going to use these passwords I reccommend you either delete or encrypt the file.
