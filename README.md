random-gen is a passion project made by me to start my programming journey. Its purpose is to make as many random generators for as many different things as possible. I am learning the basics of automation and other aspects of programming through this.
rng-v1.py is a random number generator that runs in the terminal. It can save items to files with names of your choosing.  You set an upper and lower bound for the number and then the amount of decimal places that you want. Then the amount of numbers.
passwd-gen-v1.py is a secure password generator that can be customised with length and the amount of passwords it generates it uses all characters found on a keyboard and can also print passwords to a file though if you are going to use these passwords I reccommend you either delete or encrypt the file.
